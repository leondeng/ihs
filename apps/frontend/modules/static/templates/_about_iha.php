		<p>The International Hapkido Alliance is dedicated to the propagation
			and standardisation of Hapkido along with its traditional spirit
			throughout the globe. It is the mission of the International Hapkido
			Alliance to encourage, develop, guide, and provide fellowship for
			those individuals interested in and/or practicing in the martial art
			of Hapkido, regardless of style or affiliation.</p>
		<p>The IHA promotes Hapkido as a traditional martial art and a means
			of self-defence, through instruction, seminars and other activities.
			As much as possible the IHA provides an organisation free of
			unnecessary politics as well as being able to offer international
			recognition of martial arts rank, training and instructor
			certification.</p>
